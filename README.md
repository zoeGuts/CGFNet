This is the implementation of CGFNet ([Global-Group Attention Network With Focal Attention Loss for Aerial Scene Classification](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10356044)). 

### Getting Started
1. Please prepare the dataset for aerial image classification and put it in path " data_root = r'./datasets/' " of file main\.py
2. Determine the parameters in file main\.py, and run command "python main\.py"
